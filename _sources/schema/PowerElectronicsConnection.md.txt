| ------------ | --------- |
| **Type**     | `boolean` |
| **Required** | No        |

**Description:** The connected status is related to a bus-branch model and the topological node to terminal relation.  True implies the terminal is connected to the related topological node and false implies it is not. 
In a bus-branch model, the connected status is used to tell if equipment is disconnected without having to change the connectivity described by the topological node to terminal relation. A valid case is that conducting equipment can be connected in one end and open in the other. In particular for an AC line segment, where the reactive line charging can be significant, this is a relevant case.

#### <a name="ConductingEquipmentTerminals_items_Terminalphases"></a>3.1.2. Property `PowerElectronicsConnection > ConductingEquipment.Terminals > Terminal > Terminal.phases`

| **Required**   | No                 |
| **Defined in** | ./PhaseCode.json   |

**Description:** Represents the normal network phasing condition. If the attribute is missing, three phases (ABC) shall be assumed, except for terminals of grounding classes (specializations of EarthFaultCompensator, GroundDisconnector, and Ground) which will be assumed to be N. Therefore, phase code ABCN is explicitly declared when needed, e.g. for star point grounding equipment.
The phase code on terminals connecting same ConnectivityNode or same TopologicalNode as well as for equipment between two terminals shall be consistent.

Must be one of:
* "ABCN"
* "ABC"
* "ABN"
* "ACN"
* "BCN"

|              |          |
| ------------ | -------- |
| **Type**     | `string` |
| **Required** | No       |

**Description:** The aliasName is free text human readable name of the object alternative to IdentifiedObject.name. It may be non unique and may not correlate to a naming hierarchy.
The attribute aliasName is retained because of backwards compatibility between CIM relases. It is however recommended to replace aliasName with the Name class as aliasName is planned for retirement at a future time.

| ------------ | -------- |
| **Type**     | `string` |
| **Required** | No       |

**Description:** Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The mRID is unique within an exchange context. Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID, as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID. The use of UUID is strongly recommended.
For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

**Description:** The aggregate flag provides an alternative way of representing an aggregated (equivalent) element. It is applicable in cases when the dedicated classes for equivalent equipment do not have all of the attributes necessary to represent the required level of detail.  In case the flag is set to “true” the single instance of equipment represents multiple pieces of equipment that have been modelled together as an aggregate equivalent obtained by a network reduction procedure. Examples would be power transformers or synchronous machines operating in parallel modelled as a single aggregate power transformer or aggregate synchronous machine.  
The attribute is not used for EquivalentBranch, EquivalentShunt and EquivalentInjection.

**Description:** The aggregate flag provides an alternative way of representing an aggregated (equivalent) element. It is applicable in cases when the dedicated classes for equivalent equipment do not have all of the attributes necessary to represent the required level of detail.  In case the flag is set to “true” the single instance of equipment represents multiple pieces of equipment that have been modelled together as an aggregate equivalent obtained by a network reduction procedure. Examples would be power transformers or synchronous machines operating in parallel modelled as a single aggregate power transformer or aggregate synchronous machine.  
The attribute is not used for EquivalentBranch, EquivalentShunt and EquivalentInjection.

**Description:** The aggregate flag provides an alternative way of representing an aggregated (equivalent) element. It is applicable in cases when the dedicated classes for equivalent equipment do not have all of the attributes necessary to represent the required level of detail.  In case the flag is set to “true” the single instance of equipment represents multiple pieces of equipment that have been modelled together as an aggregate equivalent obtained by a network reduction procedure. Examples would be power transformers or synchronous machines operating in parallel modelled as a single aggregate power transformer or aggregate synchronous machine.  
The attribute is not used for EquivalentBranch, EquivalentShunt and EquivalentInjection.

## <a name="IdentifiedObjectaliasName"></a>27. Property `PowerElectronicsConnection > IdentifiedObject.aliasName`

**Title:** aliasName

|              |          |
| ------------ | -------- |
| **Type**     | `string` |
| **Required** | No       |

**Description:** The aliasName is free text human readable name of the object alternative to IdentifiedObject.name. It may be non unique and may not correlate to a naming hierarchy.
The attribute aliasName is retained because of backwards compatibility between CIM relases. It is however recommended to replace aliasName with the Name class as aliasName is planned for retirement at a future time.

## <a name="IdentifiedObjectmRID"></a>28. Property `PowerElectronicsConnection > IdentifiedObject.mRID`

**Title:** mRID

|              |          |
| ------------ | -------- |
| **Type**     | `string` |
| **Required** | No       |

**Description:** Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The mRID is unique within an exchange context. Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID, as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID. The use of UUID is strongly recommended.
For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

## <a name="IdentifiedObjectname"></a>29. Property `PowerElectronicsConnection > IdentifiedObject.name`

**Title:** name

|              |          |
| ------------ | -------- |
| **Type**     | `string` |
| **Required** | No       |

**Description:** The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique text naming the object.
